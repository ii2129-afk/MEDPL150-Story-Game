<h1>Coping</h1>

<p>The two of them understand, and try to comfort you as the scientist (perhaps that is what the newer person is) treats your injuries.</p>

<p>It's another little while before you fully recover. What to do from now...? You're unsure. This isn't your home. You can only stay calm for so long. Noticing your fear, the person you met first makes an offer: they can guide you around the area if you'd like, to help you get used to the place. They want to support the possibility of you returning home, eventually, but they would at least like to make this a "home away from home" in the meanwhile. You're taken aback. So much kindness...</p>  

<p>Ultimately, you know you have to make a choice. You are staying here either way, for now.</p>
  
<a href="ending 4.html">Accept the offer, and go with them.</a><br>

<a href="ending 3.html">Decline the offer, and leave alone.</a>
