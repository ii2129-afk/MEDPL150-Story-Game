<h1>Doubting</h1>

<p>After a brief moment of hesitation, you accept. After all, you hope the message had gone through to your home, however far it is now, but you cannot be certain. Maybe if it's checked out, if the technology isn't different enough, it can be repaired. You place the communicator in the stranger's hands, and they nod at you, smiling. They offer to take you to the person who can repair it; that person in question can also quickly assess your physical condition, seeing as how you made a rough landing. That seems like a lot...</p>
