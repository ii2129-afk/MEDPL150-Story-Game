<h1>Traveling</h1>

<p>You wander for a while, encountering other beings occasionally. You can't make out their words, but their thoughts say enough, all pointing you towards the direction of one planet. It seems they think you're from there and have simply gotten lost, and your confusion is registered as playing along. It's good enough.</p>

<p>Eventually, you see a planet matching its description in the distance. It is here that you begin to make second guesses. You may receive help here, but what if the people there react differently...?</p>

<a href="main route 3.html">Land there anyway.</a><br>
