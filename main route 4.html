<p>You accept their support. They help you up, concern writ plain on their face, but the words they're physically speaking aloud are incomprehensible to you. You attempt to say something back, and they wince in what appears to be pain. That will not work... you start transmitting your thoughts back to their mind, surprising them a bit, but as you explain your situation and the gap in communication, their expression softens.</p>

<p>Eventually, your gaze turns to the small device you carry with you... your communicator. You attempt to send a message back home discreetly, but you can't see whether it sent. Much to your dismay, you didn't hide it fast enough. The stranger offers to help you and get it repaired. Just how many times will they test your trust?</p>
