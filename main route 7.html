<h1>The Beginning</h1>

<p>You hand the communicator over to who you met, who then hands it over to this new person. You grimace a bit knowing this may be your only chance to have it fixed, since you don't know how to fix it yourself. It feels just as reckless to hand it over to a total stranger from a different world, but you are short on options.</p>

<p>It takes a while, and by the time you've examined all the specks and irregularities on the wall six times over, the person returns to you with a slight frown. They attempt to explain before the stranger you met politely interrupts them, letting them know of something. From there, the person who examined your communicator sends their thoughts directly to you. So that stranger picked up on this, after all... You seem a bit surprised at the consideration.</p>

<p>The one who examined your device continues, letting you know that it seems to be broken, and no detectable signals of any kind have been sent; it's also completely unresponsive. You have no way to contact your home. You're stuck here. You are stuck in a new place... What will you do?</p>
