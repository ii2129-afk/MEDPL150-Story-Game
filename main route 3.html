<h1>Landing</h1>

<p>You choose to land, flying down towards it, but you lose balance midway, sending you tumbling towards the surface. Bracing for impact, you curl up into a ball, refusing to look at the ground below. Perhaps this was a good idea, as next thing you feel is a boom, and waves of pain shivering up your body. Everything begins to go dark...</p>

<p>You start coming to after some time, to a stranger sitting on their knees staring at you, frantically asking something you can't understand. Their thoughts are equally terrified, wondering whether you're okay mixed with relief from your having woken up. It's a lot to take in, and you sit up and jump back, startled. This was not the welcome you expected.</p>

<p>They might mean well, and your body aches... Should you really accept this?</p>
