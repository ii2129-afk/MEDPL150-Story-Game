You can hold your communicator until it's taken to that person, and from there, it will be looked at, they explain. The idea frightens you, but you are left without much choice, stranded as you are... They begin to lead you somewhere, holding your hand.</p>

<p>After a walk with many unfamiliar sights (and what seem to be baffled stares from locals), you make it to what looks like a laboratory. Another figure seems to be busy, you notice. The stranger lets you know that that's the person they had described. You wait as they bring the other person over, and prepare to give your communicator over. But, you wonder...</p>
